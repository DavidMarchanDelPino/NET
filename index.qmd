Use the quarto create project command to create a new project, using the prompt.

Terminal
quarto create project

Output
 ? Type

   blog
   manuscript
   book
   confluence

# render project in current dir
quarto render 

# render project in 'myproject'
quarto render myproject

You can also render only the files within a sub-directory of a project. For example, if the current directory contains a project with sub-directories tutorials, how-to, and articles, you can render just the contents of articles as follows:

Terminal
# render only documents in the 'articles' sub-directory
quarto render articles

Note that when rendering a project, command line arguments you pass to quarto render will be used for each file in the project. For example, this command will render only the PDF format:

Terminal
quarto render --to pdf
quarto render myproject --to pdf
